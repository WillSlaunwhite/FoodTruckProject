# Food Truck Application 

### Description
The FoodTruck class provides a shell for a food truck. Each truck has a unique name,
type and rating that are passed into it from user input and then stored in an array containing a list of food truck objects. It takes input on up to five different food trucks. Once the user has input the number of trucks they wish, they can enter quit to end input. The user is then given a menu of options for listing all food trucks, giving 
the average review of the current food trucks, or displaying the highest rated truck. If 
they enter quit, the program ends.

### Technologies Used
I used a for loop to create the trucks, take the input and assign them to the current 
index of the array. I used a do-while loop to control the menu and switch-case to control the menu based on user input.

### Lessons Learned
Obviously learned a ton about passing objects, creating objects, classes in general. My understanding of getters and setters feels a bit better but I still need to wrap my head around the proper way to use them. 

Besides that, did not expect to find uses for switch-case and do-while loops in this project. It's nice to reuse and tie in other ideas so I don't forget the concepts. 

### Questions I still have
I'm still having issues getting my scanners closed. 

I feel like my grasp on objects and classes is getting better after this project, but I still need to understand the formating and best ways to use objects and classes.
